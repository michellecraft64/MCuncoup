Contains spike times for biophysical MC with different input noise values. 
Called by the scripts: cfISIonly_SAMEgrid.m and cfAuto_Pow.m.
Note that there are many other dat files used in the paper for the values of Iap_v in-between, but we don't include them here (they can be generated from the model files)

sps[2/12/22].dat correspond to sigma=0 and Iap_v=120, 130, 140, respectively

SgPtFv[3/13/23].dat correspond to sigma=0.5 and Iap_v=120, 130, 140, respectively

SgOne[5/15/25].dat correspond to sigma=1 and Iap_v=120, 130, 140, respectively

SgOnPtFv[5/15/25].dat correspond to sigma=1.5 and Iap_v=120, 130, 140, respectively
